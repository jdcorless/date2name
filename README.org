* Handling time-stamps and date-stamps in file names

Per default, date2name gets the modification time of matching files
and directories and adds a datestamp in standard ISO 8601+ format
YYYY-MM-DD (http://datestamp.org/index.shtml) at the beginning of
the file- or directoryname.

If an existing timestamp is found, its style will be converted to the
selected ISO datestamp format but the numbers stays the same.
Executed with an examplefilename "file" this results e.g. in
"2008-12-31_file".

Note: Other that defined in ISO 8601+ the delimiter between hours,
minutes, and seconds is not a colon but a dot. Colons are causing
several problems on different file systems and are there fore replaced
with the (older) DIN 5008 version with dots.
